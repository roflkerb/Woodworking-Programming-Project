Hello and welcome to my ongoing project for ITCS 2530.
This project was born as a result of my own inability to keep track of all the data that goes into planning my woodworking ideas.

My goal for this application is to break down my woodworking into sections and calculate the board footage need for each.
This will be a great help because materials can be very expensive, so if I wanted to work through something piece by piece this application will let me know eaclty how much lumber I need for my currect section.

Seeing as this application will be developed over the course of this semester, I am not quite sure how the final product will look but I know what I would like it to contain.
In the end I would like a clear readout of all sections presented with their respective board footages. Ideally this ould be done in a series of tables that covers exact measurements.
The abilty for users to add as many sections to suit their exact need is key to this projects success.

Overall I am excited to be developing an application that I will use in the future and I think it will be very beneficial to my learning of C++ as a language.
